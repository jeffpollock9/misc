\emph{Utility-Based Behaviour Models With Application To The In-Play Tactics Of Association Football Teams}
\begin{itemize} 
\item An inhomogeneous Poisson process model for goal times in the English Premier League. The rates at which each team
scores depends on their current behaviour, which they change depending on time and score during a match, and also
depending on their current league position
\item It is shown that separate matches may not be independent, for example news of a goal may become available to a
different match, which puts one of the teams in the relegation zone, and they change their behaviour in light of this 
\item Bayesian methods are employed, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Reversible Jump MCMC, and particle filtering
methods
\end{itemize}

\section{Experience}

\cventry{2014}{Data Analyst}{Yes Campaign}{}{}{
\normalsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Processing of messy survey data into a usable format
\item Building predictive models was able to make recommendations regarding what type of people the campaign should
target and with what information
\item After the success of the work I was asked to repeat the analysis on a second survey dataset, which was presented
to members of the SNP party
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2010--2012}{Quantitative Analyst}{William Hill}{}{}{
\normalsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed statistical models which are used to drive the prices seen on the William Hill website
\item Implementation of statistical models in Java
\item Worked (largely alone) on the building and implementation of Ice Hockey models used to calculate
prices for in-play matches in the NHL and throughout Europe. The model produced a consistent profit
\item Worked as part of a team on a very large project to derive prices for in-play American Football (NFL), possibly
the most complex sport which bookmakers consider
\item Worked as part of a 2-3 man team to a very tight timescale to build and implement a Rugby Union model in time for
the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and was interviewed by the Sunday Times newspaper regarding it's success
(\url{http://tinyurl.com/pm5865f})
\item Also worked on models for other sports including Soccer, Baseball, and Cricket
\end{itemize}
